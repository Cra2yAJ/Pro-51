            <li>Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.</li>
            <li>Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can’t eat.</li>
            <li>Camels can completely shut their nostrils during sandstorms.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>There are around 160 species of chameleon.</li>
            <li>Chameleons live in warm varied habitats from rainforests through to deserts.</li>
                <li>Almost half of the world's chameleon species are native to Madagascar, they are also found in Africa, and southern Europe to as far as Sri Lanka in Asia and have been introduced to Hawaii, California and Florida.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition.</li>
            <li>Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’.</li>
            <li>Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>These magnificent mammals are omnivores. But whilst pandas will occasionally eat small animals and fish, bamboo counts for 99 percent of their diet.</li>
            <li>Pandas are BIG eaters – every day they fill their tummies for up to 12 hours, shifting up to 12 kilograms of bamboo!</li>
            <li>Baby pandas are born pink and measure about 15cm – that’s about the size of a pencil!</li>

        <ul>
            <li>The body of a cicada is similar to that of a violin or a guitar, in that much of it consists of empty, air-filled spaces that act like a resonating chamber and amplify the sound they generate.</li>
            <li>Cicada species in Arizona range in size from the large Southwestern giant floodplain cicada, only slightly shorter than the smallest North American hummingbird, to the continent’s smallest cicada, Beameria venosa, which can sit on a quarter coin with room to spare.</li>
            <li>It is very difficult to hear them. Th</li>
